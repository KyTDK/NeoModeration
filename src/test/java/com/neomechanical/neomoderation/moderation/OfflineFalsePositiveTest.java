/**
 * The safety net for evasion-resistant matching.
 *
 * <p>Matching a banned word across separators is what catches {@code f uck}. It
 * is also the change most likely to start punishing innocent players, because a
 * 400-entry list contains short entries that could in principle be assembled
 * from the ends and beginnings of adjacent innocent words. A filter that
 * punishes the innocent gets uninstalled faster than one that misses, so this
 * runs the full LDNOOBW list against ordinary English and Minecraft chat and
 * requires a clean sweep.</p>
